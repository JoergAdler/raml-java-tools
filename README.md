# raml-java-tools

This is a collection of Java tools used to work with RAML 1.0. Currently those tools are used by the [`raml-for-jaxrs`](https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-for-jax-rs) project to:
 * [Convert](raml-to-pojo/README.md) RAML specified object declarations into POJOs.
 * [Convert](pojo-to-raml/README.md) POJOs to RAML 1.0 type declarations. 
 * [Emit](raml-simple-emitter/README.md) a RAML API definition into an output stream.
 * [Programmatically build](raml-builder/README.md) a RAML 1.0 specification.
 
The other projects are experimental.
