# raml-java-tools

This is a collection of tools used to work with the RAML 1.0 spec.  Currently they are used by the raml-for-jaxrs project to:
 * [Convert](raml-to-pojo/README.md) RAML specified object declarations into POJOs.
 * [Convert](pojo-to-raml/README.md) POJOs to RAML 1.0 type declarations. 
 * [Emit](raml-emitter/README.md) a RAML API definition into an output stream.
 * [Programmatically build](raml-builder/README.md) a RAML 1.0 specification.
 
 The other projects are experiments we are trying.
